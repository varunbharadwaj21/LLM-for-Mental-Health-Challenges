# LLM Fine-Tuning and Trail Scripts

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and converted Python scripts for:
- Fine-tuning language models
- Saving and loading model checkpoints
- Running model interfaces locally

## 💡 Description

The project showcases a complete pipeline of fine-tuning a language model and exploring its capabilities through interactive scripts. While interface code is included, **you must run it locally** to see the full outputs.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some outputs are not visible due to notebook execution not being saved before upload. Please re-run the notebooks for full results.

## 📁 Files Included

- `llmtrail.py` – Script converted from `llmtrail.ipynb`
- `finetuning and saving model.py` – Script converted from `finetuning and saving model.ipynb`
- `README.md` – Project overview and licensing information

## 🚀 Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a Python environment (recommended: Python 3.8+ with `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`)
3. Run the `.py` files or Jupyter notebooks locally for best experience

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch
python "finetuning and saving model.py"
```
